Real simple HTTP CLI client.

It does not (yet) take any argument, every setting and option you need is in simpleHTTP_conf.py.


Important features :
- Support SSL (still experimental, I guess)
- Basic and Digest authentification
- GET, POST and COOKIES parameters
- You can set additionnal headers. Beware malformed headers can fail the request.
